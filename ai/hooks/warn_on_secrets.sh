If these are real credentials, move them to an environment variable. The
PallasTrade backend reads secrets from .env (gitignored by default); reference
them in code via ENV['MY_KEY']. If the matches are false positives (test
fixtures, example strings), ignore this warning.

Set PALLASTRADE_HOOKS_DISABLE=1 to silence these warnings entirely.

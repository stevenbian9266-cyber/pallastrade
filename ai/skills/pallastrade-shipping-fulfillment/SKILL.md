# PallasTrade Shipping

The shipping system answers two questions: *where is this order going* (the shipping method) and *where is it shipping from* (the stock location). Together they produce one or more Shipments — each Shipment represents a package leaving a specific StockLocation via a specific ShippingMethod.

## The shipping graph

```
Order
  └── Shipment (one per fulfillment package — may be many per order)
        ├── StockLocation        — where it ships from
        ├── ShippingRate × n     — offered rates from configured methods
        │    └── ShippingMethod  — UPS Ground, USPS Priority, etc.
        └── InventoryUnit × n    — per LineItem, each carrying a quantity (may split, e.g. partial backorder)

ShippingMethod
  ├── ShippingCategory × n       — which categories of items this method handles
  ├── Calculator                 — how much (per-order, per-item, weight-based)
  └── Zone × n                   — where this method applies

Variant
  └── ShippingCategory           — heavy items, fragile items, digital, etc.
```

Each line item's variant has a ShippingCategory. A ShippingMethod's eligibility for a shipment depends on whether the variant's category is in the method's allowed categories AND the destination is in the method's Zone.

## Shipment state machine

```
pending ──ready──→ ready ──ship──→ shipped
   │    ←─pend──     │                ↑
   │                 │                │
   └────cancel───→ canceled ──ship────┘
                      │
                      └──resume──→ ready (or pending if not yet ready)
```

(`cancel` is allowed from both `pending` and `ready`; `resume` returns a canceled shipment to `ready` — or `pending` when the order isn't ready — and a canceled shipment can be shipped directly via `ship`.)

| State | What it means |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Created but not yet ready to ship (waiting on payment, allocation, etc.) |
| `ready` | Inventory allocated, ready for the warehouse to pick |
| `shipped` | Picked up by carrier; tracking number set |
| `canceled` | Order was canceled; the shipment doesn't go out |

Transitions: `ready`, `pend` (back to pending), `ship`, `cancel`, `resume`. The `ship` transition fires the `shipment.shipped` event (subscribers see it) and updates `order.shipment_state` to `shipped` or `partial` based on the order's other shipments. The `cancel` and `resume` transitions fire `shipment.canceled` and `shipment.resumed` respectively.

## How shipping rates get calculated

When an order enters the `delivery` checkout state (after address):

```
For each Shipment in order:
  package = shipment.to_package
  PallasTrade::Stock::Estimator.new(order).shipping_rates(package)
    ↓
    For each ShippingMethod where:
      - method.shipping_categories.include?(variant.shipping_category)
      - method.zones.include?(zone_for(order.ship_address))
    ↓
    Run method.calculator.compute(package)
    ↓
    ShippingRate(shipping_method: method, cost: amount, selected: best)
```

The cheapest rate per Shipment is `selected: true` by default. The customer can pick a different one in the checkout UI.

## Built-in calculators

| Calculator | Computes |
|---|---|
| `PallasTrade::Calculator::Shipping::FlatRate` | Same flat rate; optional min/max weight and item-total bounds (returns nil → method unavailable outside them) |
| `PallasTrade::Calculator::Shipping::FlatPercentItemTotal` | % of order item total |
| `PallasTrade::Calculator::Shipping::PerItem` | Rate × number of items |
| `PallasTrade::Calculator::Shipping::FlexiRate` | Tiered by item count |
| `PallasTrade::Calculator::Shipping::PriceSack` | Tiered by order total (e.g. under $50 = $10, over $50 = free) |
| `PallasTrade::Calculator::Shipping::DigitalDelivery` | Configurable amount (default 0); only available when every item in the package is digital |

Custom shipping calculators subclass `PallasTrade::ShippingCalculator` and implement `compute_package(package)` (optionally `available?(package)`). The package is a `PallasTrade::Stock::Package` with contents, total weight, and item total.

## StockLocation

Stock is tracked per-Variant per-StockLocation via `PallasTrade::StockItem`. A store has at least one StockLocation; multi-warehouse stores have many.

```ruby
warehouse = PallasTrade::StockLocation.create!(
  name: 'East Coast Warehouse',
  address1: '...',
  city: '...',
  state_id: PallasTrade::State.find_by(name: 'New York').id,
  country_id: PallasTrade::Country.find_by(iso: 'US').id,
  propagate_all_variants: true,  # auto-create StockItem for every Variant
  active: true,
  backorderable_default: false,
  default: false                 # only one StockLocation can be the default
)

variant.stock_items.where(stock_location: warehouse).first.count_on_hand
variant.total_on_hand   # summed across all locations
```

### StockMovement

Stock changes are recorded as `PallasTrade::StockMovement` entries — an audit log:

```ruby
stock_item = warehouse.stock_item_or_create(variant)
stock_item.stock_movements.create!(
  quantity: 10,                  # positive = received, negative = sold/lost
  originator: purchase_order     # polymorphic — what caused the movement
)
# or the higher-level helpers (these wrap the same StockMovement creation):
warehouse.restock(variant, 10, purchase_order)
warehouse.unstock(variant, 2, shipment)
```

Don't update `count_on_hand` directly; create a StockMovement and let the model recompute the count.

## How Shipments split across StockLocations

When an order is split into shipments, PallasTrade groups InventoryUnits by where they can ship from:

```
Order has 3 items: [A from East, B from East, C from West]
  ↓
Order Routing (`order.order_routing_strategy.for_allocation`, default `PallasTrade::OrderRouting::Strategy::Rules`) ranks eligible StockLocations via the channel's routing rules, packs each location (`PallasTrade::Stock::Packer` + the `PallasTrade.stock_splitters` chain), and `PallasTrade::Stock::Prioritizer` assigns each inventory unit to the first ranked package with on-hand stock
  ↓
Creates 2 Shipments:
  - Shipment 1: items A + B from East Warehouse
  - Shipment 2: item C from West Warehouse
```

Since PallasTrade 5.5, *which* stock locations fulfill an order is decided by **Order Routing**, not the splitters. Each Channel has an ordered list of `PallasTrade::OrderRoutingRule` rows (STI subclasses: `PallasTrade::OrderRouting::Rules::PreferredLocation`, `MinimizeSplits`, `DefaultLocation` — seeded in that priority order) that rank the candidate stock locations. The routing strategy is configurable via `store.preferred_order_routing_strategy` (default `PallasTrade::OrderRouting::Strategy::Rules`), overridable per channel; `PallasTrade::OrderRouting::Strategy::Legacy` restores the pre-5.5 `PallasTrade::Stock::Coordinator` behavior and is dropped in 6.0. Splitters then break each chosen location's allocation into packages *within* that location.

Each Shipment gets its own ShippingRate calculation (different origin = different rates). The customer pays each shipment's selected rate.

For location-preference logic — distance-based, prefer-closest-warehouse, minimize splits — write a custom order routing rule or strategy, see `node_modules/@pallastrade/docs/dist/developer/how-to/custom-order-routing.md`. For breaking one location's allocation into more packages (refrigerated, hazmat, gift wrap), write a custom splitter — see `node_modules/@pallastrade/docs/dist/developer/how-to/custom-stock-splitter.md`.

### Manual fulfillments (3PL / external fulfillment)

To mirror an externally-managed fulfillment back into PallasTrade — a 3PL or courier API shipped part of a completed order — use `PallasTrade::Fulfillments::Create` (5.5+) instead of hand-building shipments. It bypasses order routing, moves the requested not-yet-shipped units out of their current shipments into a new one, and handles the stock bookkeeping (restock at source / unstock at target when locations differ):

```ruby
result = PallasTrade.fulfillment_create_service.call(
  order: order,                       # must be completed, not canceled
  stock_location: three_pl_location,
  items: [{ line_item: li, quantity: 1 }],   # nil = everything not yet shipped
  tracking: '1Z…',
  delivery_method: shipping_method,   # defaults to the drained source shipment's
  cost: '12.50',                      # explicit 3PL price; defaults to carrying over the source cost
  status: 'shipped'                   # register as already shipped ('shipped' is the only accepted value; omit for pending)
)

result.valid? # true if the fulfillment was created successfully
```

Note an explicit `cost` sticks only with `status: 'shipped'` — pending fulfillments get re-priced by the rate engine on the next recalculation.

## Returns + Reverse Logistics

A customer wants to return an item:

```
ReturnAuthorization (admin-created, lists which InventoryUnits)
  ↓
Customer ships item back
  ↓
CustomerReturn (admin-received, links InventoryUnits to receipt)
  ↓
Reimbursement (calculates the refund amount from the return items' amounts — admins can adjust per-item amounts before reimbursing)
  ↓
Refund (to original payment) OR StoreCredit
```

Admin creates a `ReturnAuthorization` listing the InventoryUnits the customer is returning. When the items come back, an admin records a `CustomerReturn` to mark the units received. The `Reimbursement` calculates the refund amount from the return items' amounts, and produces either a `Refund` (back to the original payment method) or a `StoreCredit`.

## Customizing shipping

### Custom calculator

```ruby
# app/models/pallastrade/calculator/shipping/weight_based.rb
module PallasTrade
  class Calculator::Shipping::WeightBased < PallasTrade::ShippingCalculator
    preference :rate_per_kg, :decimal, default: 5.00

    def compute_package(package)
      package.weight * preferred_rate_per_kg
    end
  end
end

# Register so it shows in the admin shipping method UI (config/initializers/pallastrade.rb)
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  PallasTrade.calculators.shipping_methods << PallasTrade::Calculator::Shipping::WeightBased
end
```

### Hooking into shipment events

For external warehouse integration, subscribe to `shipment.shipped`:

```ruby
class ShipmentShippedSubscriber < PallasTrade::Subscriber
  subscribes_to 'shipment.shipped'

  def call(event)
    shipment = PallasTrade::Shipment.find_by_prefix_id(event.payload['id'])
    return unless shipment

    ExternalWarehouseAPI.notify_dispatched(
      tracking: shipment.tracking,
      shipping_method: shipment.shipping_method.name,
      order_number: shipment.order.number
    )
  end
end
```

See the `pallastrade-events-webhooks` skill for the events system.

### Custom shipping rate ranking

By default, the cheapest rate is selected. To prefer carrier reliability, decorate `PallasTrade::Stock::Estimator`:

```ruby
module PallasTrade::Stock::EstimatorDecorator
  # which rate is pre-selected
  def choose_default_shipping_rate(rates)
    preferred = rates.find { |r| r.shipping_method.name == 'UPS Ground' }
    (preferred || rates.min_by(&:cost))&.selected = true
  end

  # display order
  def sort_shipping_rates(rates)
    rates.sort_by { |r| [r.shipping_method.name == 'UPS Ground' ? 0 : 1, r.cost] }
  end

  PallasTrade::Stock::Estimator.prepend self
end
```

Note: `sort_shipping_rates` only affects display order; `choose_default_shipping_rate` (which runs first, picking the cheapest by default) decides which rate gets `selected: true`.

## Common shipping problems

### "Shipment stuck in `pending`"

Walk this list:

1. **Payment not complete?** Shipment doesn't move to `ready` until the order is paid. `order.payment_state == 'paid'`.
2. **Inventory not allocated?** `shipment.inventory_units.all? { |iu| iu.on_hand? }` — if any are `backordered`, it's waiting on stock.
3. **`determine_state` returning `pending`?** That's the explicit blocker; check what state the Shipment thinks the order is in via `shipment.determine_state(shipment.order)`.

### "No shipping rates appear at checkout"

- **No ShippingMethod covers the address's Zone.** Add a method for the country, OR add the country to an existing method's Zone.
- **No ShippingMethod covers the variant's ShippingCategory.** Make sure each variant has a category and each method allows that category.
- **All methods' calculators return nil/zero erroneously.** Inspect rates by calling `PallasTrade::Stock::Estimator.new(order).shipping_rates(package)` for each `package` in `order.shipments.map(&:to_package)` in the console.

### "Order ships from the wrong warehouse"

Order Routing decides the location: the default `PallasTrade::OrderRouting::Strategy::Rules` walks the channel's routing rules (preferred_location → minimize_splits → default_location baseline). Adjust the channel's `PallasTrade::OrderRoutingRule` rows, or for closest-warehouse-wins write a custom routing rule (implementing `#rank(order, locations)`) or strategy — see `node_modules/@pallastrade/docs/dist/developer/how-to/custom-order-routing.md`.

### "Shipping rate doesn't update when cart changes"

The rates are cached per Shipment after first calculation. When the cart changes (line item added/removed), the Shipment is destroyed and recreated, so rates do recompute at the next call to `PallasTrade::Stock::Estimator`. If you're displaying rates in a Turbo Frame, make sure to re-render on cart updates.

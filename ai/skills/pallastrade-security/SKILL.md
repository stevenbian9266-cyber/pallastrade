# PallasTrade Security

PallasTrade inherits Rails' security model and adds an e-commerce attack surface (payment data, customer PII, admin credentials, webhook endpoints). This skill covers both.

## The threat model in three sentences

1. The **storefront** is internet-facing — every visitor can hit it. Threats: XSS via product content, IDOR on orders, abuse of cart endpoints.
2. The **admin** is staff-only but credentials get phished — assume someone is going to log in as a regular admin sometimes. Threats: privilege escalation, broad data exfiltration, malicious extension upload.
3. The **payments path** touches money and PCI. Threats: card data leaking into logs/DB, gateway response tampering, refund abuse.

Everything below maps to one of these.

## Standard Rails security (don't skip these)

### Secrets — not in the repo

Production credentials live in `config/credentials.yml.enc` (Rails encrypted credentials) or environment variables. **Never** check raw secrets into git.

```bash
# Read credentials
EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit --environment production

# Look up
Rails.application.credentials.stripe[:secret_key]
```

If a secret leaks into a commit (even on a private repo): **rotate immediately**, then rewrite history (`git filter-repo`, `bfg`). Rotation order:
1. Rotate the key in the provider (Stripe, AWS, etc.).
2. Update credentials/env.
3. Deploy.
4. Then clean history. The order matters — clean history first and the leaked key keeps working until rotation.

The PallasTrade Agent Skills plugin (installed via `/plugin install pallastrade@pallastrade` in Claude Code) ships a PostToolUse hook that warns when Claude appears to be writing a known-shape secret (Stripe live keys, AWS keys, GitHub PATs, OpenAI/Anthropic keys, plaintext sensitive env names). It's a tripwire, not a substitute for review.

### Strong Parameters

Always whitelist params in controllers; never `params.permit!` or splat user input into mass-assignment:

```ruby
# ✅
def permitted_params
  params.permit(:name, :description, :slug, metadata: {})
end

# ❌ — accepts anything, including admin_id / is_admin / etc.
PallasTrade::Product.create!(params[:product])
```

PallasTrade v3 controllers use flat `params.permit(...)` — no nested wrapping. See `pallastrade-api-v3` and `pallastrade-resource` for the convention.

### SQL injection

Use parameterized queries:

```ruby
# ✅
PallasTrade::Product.where('price > ?', user_value)
PallasTrade::Product.where(price: user_value)

# ❌ — string interpolation
PallasTrade::Product.where("price > #{user_value}")
```

Ransack is safe by default — but only filters on **allowlisted** attributes. Declare per model:

```ruby
self.whitelisted_ransackable_attributes = %w[name slug created_at price]
self.whitelisted_ransackable_associations = %w[variants categories]
self.whitelisted_ransackable_scopes = %w[available in_stock]
```

Filtering on an un-allowlisted attribute is silently ignored — Ransack's default `ignore_unknown_conditions: true` drops the unknown condition (PallasTrade's v3 controllers call `ransack`, not `ransack!`), so the user can't exfiltrate `password_digest` via `q[password_digest_eq]=...`. But there's no error signal either: the response is 200 and that filter simply doesn't apply, while any valid conditions in the same query still do.

### Mass assignment

Same answer as Strong Parameters above — `params.permit` is the mass-assignment defense; nothing extra is needed on the model.

Do **not** reach for `attr_readonly` here: it blocks *all* writes after creation, not just mass assignment. With Rails 7.1+ defaults, assigning a readonly attribute on a persisted record raises `ActiveRecord::ReadonlyAttributeError` (on older defaults the write is silently dropped). Putting it on `encrypted_password` breaks Devise password changes and password resets for every existing user. Reserve `attr_readonly` for genuinely immutable columns:

```ruby
class PallasTrade::Order < PallasTrade.base_class
  attr_readonly :number  # generated once, never changes
end
```

### CSRF

Rails handles CSRF for browser sessions automatically (`protect_from_forgery with: :exception`). API controllers skip CSRF (token auth replaces it). **Don't disable CSRF on form-rendering controllers** — that's how XSS becomes RCE-via-admin.

### CSP (Content Security Policy)

Lock down what scripts/styles/images can load:

```ruby
# config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb
Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |policy|
  policy.default_src :self
  policy.font_src    :self, :https, :data
  policy.img_src     :self, :https, :data
  policy.script_src  :self, 'https://js.stripe.com'
  policy.style_src   :self, :unsafe_inline   # the Rails admin's inline styles need this; relax over time
  policy.connect_src :self, 'https://api.stripe.com'
end
```

The storefront should have a stricter policy than the admin. If your storefront uses a separate domain (Next.js consuming the Store API), set CSP on that app, not on the Rails app.

### XSS

Rails auto-escapes ERB output. Where you raw-render user content (rich text descriptions, product copy from CSV import), sanitize:

```ruby
ActionController::Base.helpers.sanitize(product.description, tags: %w[p br strong em a ul li], attributes: %w[href])
```

Sanitize before storing OR before rendering, but pick one and be consistent.

### CORS

PallasTrade also ships an admin-manageable CORS allowlist for the Admin API — per-store `PallasTrade::AllowedOrigin` records (validated to be origin-only http(s) URLs), managed in the dashboard under Settings → Allowed origins or via the Admin API (`/api/v3/admin/allowed_origins`). The pallastrade-starter app's `config/initializers/cors.rb` consults it dynamically (cached, exact-match in production) for `/api/v3/admin/*` with `credentials: true` — so admin/dashboard origins belong in that allowlist, not in hand-written `allow` blocks. For your storefront origin on `/api/v3/store/*`, add a static `allow` block as shown below.

If your storefront is a separate origin (typical for Next.js):

```ruby
# config/initializers/cors.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
  allow do
    origins 'https://my-storefront.com', /https:\/\/.*\.my-storefront\.com/
    resource '/api/v3/store/*',
             headers: :any,
             methods: %i[get post put patch delete options],
             expose: %w[x-pallastrade-api-version]
  end
end
```

**Never `origins '*'` in production** for paths that accept credentials. Allowlist explicit storefront origins.

## PallasTrade-specific security

### Publishable key vs secret key

```
pk_*  — Publishable key.  Safe to ship in client-side code.  Identifies store, permits public Store API endpoints only.
sk_*  — Secret key.       Server-to-server only. Never bundle into mobile apps or browser JS.
```

A leaked `pk_` is annoying but not catastrophic (rate limit, rotate). A leaked `sk_` is a breach — rotate immediately and audit `PallasTrade::WebhookDelivery`/admin audit logs for unauthorized activity.

### Scopes on secret keys

When creating a secret key for an integration (Settings → API keys → Create secret key), grant **only the scopes the integration needs**. Don't hand out `write_all` to every app.

```
Need to sync orders out? → read_orders
Need to update inventory? → write_stock
Need to create refunds? → write_refunds
```

If the integration is later compromised, the blast radius is limited to what its scopes permit. The full scope list is in the `pallastrade-api-v3` skill.

### CanCanCan abilities (admin JWT auth)

Admin users authenticate via JWT and authorize via `PallasTrade::Ability`, which builds permissions from Permission Sets assigned to the user's roles. Customize by defining a permission set and assigning it to a role:

```ruby
# app/models/my_app/permission_sets/wholesale_orders.rb
module MyApp
  module PermissionSets
    class WholesaleOrders < PallasTrade::PermissionSets::Base
      def activate!
        # Wholesale managers can read+update wholesale orders but never destroy
        can [:read, :update], PallasTrade::Order, channel: { code: 'wholesale' }
        cannot :destroy, PallasTrade::Order
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# config/initializers/pallastrade.rb
Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  PallasTrade.permissions.assign(:wholesale_manager, [
    PallasTrade::PermissionSets::DashboardDisplay,
    MyApp::PermissionSets::WholesaleOrders
  ])
end
```

(The role itself must exist: `PallasTrade::Role.find_or_create_by(name: 'wholesale_manager')`.)

Defaults are restrictive — users with no roles get only `PallasTrade::PermissionSets::DefaultCustomer`. Build up explicit grants per role by composing built-in sets (`OrderManagement`, `ProductDisplay`, `StockManagement`, …) with custom ones; don't hand every role `SuperUser`.

### DB-driven role permissions (2026-08-16, admin)

Since the permission-system refactor, **admin roles are authorized from the DB** (`PallasTrade::RolePermission`), not only code permission sets:

- `PallasTrade::Ability#apply_permissions_from_db` reads the user's role permissions; if any exist for the user's roles, DB fully drives (set/function/menu/data). The `admin` role is seeded with `set: SuperUser` via `Role.default_admin_role`. Users with no DB-configured roles fall back to code permission sets (`DefaultCustomer` etc.).
- **function** grants are `resource × action` (read/create/update/destroy/export/manage). `manage` = all actions. Each grant also implies `:admin` on that resource (admin-panel entry gate).
- **data** grants scope reads via CanCanCan conditions so `accessible_by` filters lists (scope: `self` → `user_id = current user`, `store`/`channel` → the configured value, `custom` → admin-supplied simple hash). Resources must be registered in `PallasTrade::PermissionRegistry` (`backend/config/initializers/pallastrade_permission_registry.rb`).
- **menu** grants control sidebar visibility (`ability.menu_permissions`); a DB-driven role's menu tree is decided entirely by menu grants.
- Admin role-permission editing happens in the Roles edit page (three tabs: menu/function/data) — see the `pallastrade-admin` skill. `nav:validate` enforces that permission resources are registered.

Keep `set`-type permissions (SuperUser) out of the rebuild path — the UI never edits them.

### Payment method preferences

Payment methods (Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, etc.) store their gateway credentials as PallasTrade preferences on the `PallasTrade::PaymentMethod` record. These end up in `pallastrade_payment_methods.preferences` as a serialized column.

Two precautions:

- **Gateway preferences are stored UNENCRYPTED** as serialized YAML in `pallastrade_payment_methods.preferences` — treat the database and its backups as containing live secrets. Two pieces of key material do matter elsewhere: keep `secret_key_base` stable, because secret API key authentication HMAC-SHA256s tokens with it (rotating it invalidates every `sk_` key; publishable `pk_` keys are unaffected), and configure `active_record_encryption` credentials consistently, because webhook endpoint secrets are encrypted with ActiveRecord::Encryption when those keys are present.
- **Use the admin UI to enter live keys** (Settings → Payments → edit method), not seed scripts or direct DB writes. Treat preference rows as containing live secrets; back up encrypted.

If a gateway secret leaks (committed to git, exposed in a log, copied to a chat), rotate at the provider first (Stripe dashboard, Adyen back office), then update the admin preference, then audit recent transactions.

### Webhook signature verification (HMAC)

Outbound webhooks are signed with HMAC-SHA256. **Receivers MUST verify** — see the `pallastrade-events-webhooks` skill for the exact algorithm + timing-safe comparison + replay rejection. PallasTrade won't tell you if your receiver is unverified; that's the receiver's responsibility.

### Webhook SSRF protection

Inbound URL validation: in production, webhook endpoint URLs are checked against private IP ranges (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local) via `ssrf_filter`. Admin can't (easily) make PallasTrade POST to `http://internal-erp.localhost:8080` from outside the trusted network.

In development this is disabled so localhost webhooks work. **Never run development settings in production**; this gap is a real SSRF in deployed apps if you copy `Rails.env.development?` checks blindly.

### PCI DSS scope

PallasTrade never stores raw PANs. Payment data flows through tokenization at the gateway:
- **Stripe** (via `pallastrade_stripe`) — card data goes browser→Stripe directly via Stripe Elements / Checkout. PallasTrade only sees a payment-method token.
- **Adyen** (via `pallastrade_adyen`) — same pattern; the drop-in component returns a tokenized reference.
- **`PallasTrade::CreditCard`** stores last4, brand, exp month/year — never the full PAN, never the CVC.

PCI scope reduction relies on this. **Don't add fields to `pallastrade_credit_cards` that hold raw card data.** If you find yourself wanting to, it's a sign you're building the wrong integration pattern — gateway tokenization is the right answer.

If a regulator asks for your PCI SAQ:
- Using only tokenizing gateways with hosted fields: SAQ A-EP or SAQ A.
- Self-collecting card data anywhere: SAQ D (full audit). Don't go here.

### Customer-data isolation

Multi-store stores share a database. **Always scope queries through `current_store`**:

```ruby
# ✅
@orders = current_store.orders.where(user: current_user)

# ❌ — leaks orders from other stores
@orders = PallasTrade::Order.where(user: current_user)
```

The Store API does this automatically via the `PallasTrade::Api::V3::Store::ResourceController` base class. Custom controllers must replicate the pattern.

### IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

Customer A trying to load `/api/v3/store/orders/or_<customerB_order>`. The Store API's `OrdersController#scope` restricts to the current user's orders (or the guest order token), so the lookup returns 404 — but if you override `scope`/`find_resource` or write a custom controller, you must replicate that scoping.

Prefixed IDs don't help here — they're discoverable (sequential PKs under the hood). **Always authorize, never rely on ID opacity.**

### Rate limiting

PallasTrade's v3 API ships application-level rate limiting out of the box, built on Rails' `rate_limit` and backed by `Rails.cache`:

- **All v3 endpoints**: 300 requests / 60s, keyed by the `X-PallasTrade-Api-Key` header (falling back to client IP when no key is sent).
- **Auth endpoints** (per IP, to stop brute force): login 5/60s, registration 3/60s, token refresh and logout 10/60s, password reset 3/60s. Admin login/refresh and invitation acceptance get the same treatment.

Exceeding a limit returns `429` with error code `rate_limit_exceeded` and `Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-*` headers. All limits are tunable via `PallasTrade::Api::Config` preferences: `rate_limit_per_key`, `rate_limit_window`, `rate_limit_login`, `rate_limit_register`, `rate_limit_refresh`, `rate_limit_password_reset`. One operational caveat: counters live in `Rails.cache`, so multi-process deployments need a shared cache store (Redis/Memcached) — with an in-process store each worker counts independently.

Still layer defense in depth on top:

- **Rack::Attack** for endpoints the built-in limits don't cover (Rails admin, storefront) and any custom throttling rules — don't duplicate the v3 auth throttles, they're already enforced.
- **CDN / load balancer** (Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS WAF) for the global ceiling and volumetric attacks.

Tune the numbers to your traffic shape — the defaults cap a leaked publishable key at 300 req/min, but a scraper rotating IPs without a key still warrants the CDN layer.

### Dependency hygiene

```bash
bundle audit                # CVEs in Ruby gems
npm audit / pnpm audit      # CVEs in JS deps
brakeman                    # Rails static analysis
```

Run these in CI. The PallasTrade Agent Skills plugin doesn't ship an application security CI workflow — you wire these into your own.

### Admin upload safety

Admins can upload images and CSVs (imports). Risks:
- **Polyglot files** (image+JS) — sanitize uploads, set `Content-Type` strictly, serve from a different origin than the app domain (S3 + CloudFront, not `app.example.com/uploads/…`).
- **CSV formula injection** — sanitize fields starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` before writing back to user-downloaded CSV exports.

### Sensitive logs

Rails param filtering is already largely in place: PallasTrade core registers `filter_parameters` for `:password`, `:number`, `:verification_value`, `:client_secret`, `:refresh_token` etc., and the pallastrade-starter app ships partial-match filters (`:passw, :email, :secret, :token, :_key, :crypt, :salt, :cvv, :cvc, …`) — partial matching means `:secret` already catches `secret_key`/`stripe_secret_key` and `:_key` catches `api_key`/`publishable_key`.

Treat this as defense-in-depth, not a solved problem: extend the list for any custom param name your app introduces that the partial matches don't cover, and verify what's actually filtered:

```ruby
# config/initializers/filter_parameter_logging.rb
Rails.application.config.filter_parameters += %i[card_number my_custom_credential]

# Verify in console:
Rails.application.config.filter_parameters
```

A param name that slips through the filters gets written verbatim to production.log by any form POST that carries it.

## A short checklist for a new PallasTrade deployment

- [ ] Production credentials in encrypted credentials or environment, **not** in repo.
- [ ] `secret_key_base` stable and managed via credentials — secret API keys are HMAC-digested with it (rotating it invalidates every `sk_` key) and it is the fallback JWT signing secret. Webhook endpoint secrets use ActiveRecord::Encryption, whose keys (`active_record_encryption.*`) must also live in credentials.
- [ ] CORS allowlist matches your storefront origin(s) only.
- [ ] CSP defined and not `default_src 'unsafe-inline'` everywhere.
- [ ] Brakeman + bundle audit + pnpm audit in CI.
- [ ] Rack::Attack rules for login + checkout endpoints.
- [ ] Webhook receiver verifies HMAC + checks replay timestamp.
- [ ] All staff admin users on real-name accounts with role-appropriate abilities (no shared "admin@" accounts).
- [ ] Secret keys for integrations granted minimum scopes.
- [ ] Filtered parameters configured for logs.
- [ ] Database backups are encrypted, restorable, and not stored next to the database.
- [ ] HTTPS-only (`config.force_ssl = true`).
- [ ] `Secure` + `HttpOnly` + `SameSite=Lax` on auth cookies.
